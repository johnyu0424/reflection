When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repository, you get to share your work easily online and people can view it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Becasue you might be working on something with a group of people, and you don't want to add their update until your part is done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are done only on GitHub repositories.
Clones can be done both on GitHub to local or vice versa.
Branches are just new branch of the existing code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You will not need internet access to obtain the last know state of the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git or GitHub, code will have to be sent as attachment or have to use automatic version control from services like Dropbox or Google Drive.
Github and Git made it easier for us to collaborate online and offline, but at the same time, it requires all the parties invole to have a good knowledge of Git and GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you're testing out new stuff and would like to have people approve it before it goes into the master or when you're working on adding features into an open-source project.
Making changes directly in the master is easier in the sense that you don't have to do all the merging, pushing, and pulling. However, you run the risk of not having a stable master.
